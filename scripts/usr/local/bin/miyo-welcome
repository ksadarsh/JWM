Miyo-JWM was made so that users could have a minimal and base system on which to add the software and applications that they choose. It's up to the user to decide which web browser, music player, office suite, video player, etc. goes on their system.

Live Username - miyo
Live Password - miyo
Live Root Password - miyo

<span font_weight='bold'>SPECIAL NOTE 1:</span>  Please see the Live User Notes for a very important message about using the Theme Changer while running Miyo-JWM in this live environment!

<span font_weight='bold'>SPECIAL NOTE 2:</span>  For non-English installations...there are notes near the top of both the Release Notes and Live User Notes for users who may install Miyo-JWM in a non-English locale/language. Please read them in order to help you have a better experience.

The Live User Notes and Release Notes both contain information to help you in this live session and after installation. They are located in the Documents folder of the file manager. However, you can easily access them by clicking on <span font_weight='bold'>Live User Notes</span> and <span font_weight='bold'>Release Notes</span>. The Live User Notes will be deleted after installation; however, the Release Notes will remain on the installed system. If you decide to install MiyoLinux, please take time soon after to read over the Release Notes.

MiyoLinux uses the US keyboard layout by default; however, you can change the keyboard layout in the live session by clicking on <span font_weight='bold'>Change Keyboard Layout</span>. When the application opens, find your desired layout, click on it, then click OK. The system will then adopt your layout.

Also, you can connect to your network by clicking on <span font_weight='bold'>Network Connections</span>. Wired connections should connect automatically. See the Live User Notes for more information on connecting to a Wireless Network.

Finally, if you want to jump right in, you can install the system straight from here by clicking on <span font_weight='bold'>Install MiyoLinux</span>. However, if you would prefer to explore MiyoLinux further, the installer can also be found in the <span font_weight='bold'>System</span> category of the menu.
